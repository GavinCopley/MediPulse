    "# Hospital Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "Builds an algorithm using machine learning to recommend the best hospital based on user selections—medical issue, priority (e.g., quality, safety, or experience), and acceptable travel distance. Combines a Flask backend (serving hospital data from a CSV) with a user-facing frontend (HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet for maps).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend (HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **User Location & Medical Issue**  \n",
    "   - The user can choose a location (has anonymous options liek san diego zoo or petco park in case the user isnt comfortable sharing) and select a specific medical issue from a dropdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **“What’s Most Important”**  \n",
    "   - The frontend offers a choice among three key priorities:\n",
    "     - **Quality**  \n",
    "     - **Experience**  \n",
    "     - **Safety**  \n",
    "   - A distance slider lets the user specify a maximum travel range.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Request & Display**  \n",
    "   - On form submission, the frontend sends a POST request to the Flask endpoint with the user's location, distance, medical issue, and priority.\n",
    "   - Receives a recommended hospital—or a list of top hospitals—and displays them:\n",
    "     - Basic hospital info (name, distance).\n",
    "     - A Leaflet map with markers for each recommended facility and the user’s location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Styling & Feedback**  \n",
    "   - Utilizes TailwindCSS for a responsive layout and user-friendly design.\n",
    "   - Shows loading/error messages and a clear results section once the recommendation is computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backend (Flask + Custom Model or Weighted RandomForest)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**  \n",
    "   - Reads from a pre-cleaned CSV (`hospitaldatamodified.csv`) containing columns like:\n",
    "     - `hospital`\n",
    "     - `performance measure` (medical issue)\n",
    "     - `latitude`, `longitude`\n",
    "     - `# of cases`, `# of adverse events`, `risk-adjusted rate`\n",
    "     - (Optional) `quality` or similar metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Calculation**  \n",
    "   - Uses a Haversine formula to compute how far each hospital is from the user's chosen lat/lon.\n",
    "   - Filters out hospitals beyond the user’s max travel distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prioritization Logic**  \n",
    "   - **Enhanced Priority Weighting (RandomForest approach)**  \n",
    "     - Encodes disease/priority, scales numeric features, and trains a random forest.  \n",
    "     - Increases the multiplier for the priority feature so that “What’s most important” strongly affects which hospital is chosen.  \n",
    "   - **OR**  \n",
    "   - **Custom Scoring (Direct Formula)**  \n",
    "     - For safety, fewer adverse events is better.  \n",
    "     - For experience, higher # of cases.  \n",
    "     - For quality, “better than expected” > “as expected” > “worse.”  \n",
    "     - Incorporates distance as a penalty so closer facilities rank higher when priorities tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flask Endpoint**  \n",
    "   - A POST endpoint `/api/predict` that accepts JSON:\n",
    "     ```json\n",
    "     {\n",
    "       \"disease\": \"Acute Stroke\",\n",
    "       \"priority\": \"safety\",\n",
    "       \"distance\": 10,\n",
    "       \"user_lat\": 32.71,\n",
    "       \"user_lon\": -117.16\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Returns JSON with the recommended hospital(s) or an error if none match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ## Backend Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the core Python libraries used in the backend to process the hospital CSV data and serve recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas**  \n",
    "  - For reading CSV files, cleaning and transforming the data, and handling imputation of missing values.\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn**  \n",
    "  - Provides the RandomForestClassifier (if using the machine-learning approach) and tools like `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.\n",
    "- **Joblib**  \n",
    "  - Used to serialize (save/load) the trained model and its associated encoders or scalers.\n",
    "- **Math**  \n",
    "  - For the Haversine formula to calculate distances between user and hospital coordinates.\n",
    "- **Flask** (and optionally **Flask-RESTful**)  \n",
    "  - To create the API endpoint that receives user input (disease, priority, distance, lat/lon) and returns a recommended hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this architecture, “What’s most important to you?” now drives the final recommendation more effectively while maintaining the overall workflow of data loading, distance filtering, and hospital output.\n"
